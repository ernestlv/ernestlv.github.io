		   	<h2>Ghost</h2>
			<p>
				<b>A</b>nd then you were gone and I remember I was alone. I have always been. You never existed. It was all just a dream. It was always just me thinking that You persisted, that You were truly there but You were not. You never did. Just an empty room, four walls encasing vacuum, that is You. Beauty will be gone but freedom will stay forever.
